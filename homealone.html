     <h3>HOME ALONE</h3>
     <p>Home Alone: In "Home Alone," eight-year-old Kevin McCallister gets accidentally left behind when his entire family rushes off on a Christmas vacation. Initially thrilled to be home alone, the joy quickly fades    as Kevin realizes he must fend for himself and defend his house from two bumbling burglars. Armed with booby traps, ingenuity, and a surprising amount of courage, Kevin transforms his home into an obstacle course of hilarious chaos, leaving the burglars wishing they'd never chosen that house. This heartwarming holiday classic celebrates the resourcefulness of childhood, the importance of family, and the triumph of good over evil, wrapped in a blanket of snow and festive spirit.</p>
