     <h3>LION KING</h3>
     <p>Lion King: Simba, a young lion cub destined for kinghood, is tricked by his jealous uncle Scar into believing he caused his father Mufasa's death. Banished and filled with guilt, Simba flees the Pride Lands and grows up with carefree outcasts Timon and Pumbaa. Years later, a grown Simba is haunted by his past and encounters his childhood friend Nala, who reminds him of his responsibility. Guided by his wise shaman Rafiki and motivated by the spirit of his father, Simba must confront Scar, reclaim his rightful place, and restore balance to the kingdom. It's a classic coming-of-age story about overcoming loss, facing responsibility, and the unbreakable circle of life.</p>
